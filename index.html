            <p class="brief">Honkai: Star Rail starts with a bang, serenading you with a symphony and blowing up a space station. You quickly ground yourself in a world with code-locked chrome doors, mech-like invaders with bladed arms, and rooms with monitors spread across the walls. Its hook of a prologue gives just enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking around for without grinding. Charming characters, engaging combat, and carefully crafted worlds blend together into a game with enough content to keep you entertained for well over 50 hours, using polished versions of the progression systems from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact to create HoYoverse’s best RPG yet.
                <br><br>HoYo has a reputation for crafting gacha games with a strong emphasis on story, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to it. You play as the Trailblazer, an amnesiac protagonist who travels planet to planet on a train-like spaceship-like train called the Astral Express. It becomes a story surrounding the train’s crew, their backstories, and the different planets they visit. The story has its own twists and turns with some questionable pacing, but eventually it leads to an entertaining outcome that kept me wanting more. 
                <br><br>Honkai: Star Rail has three major worlds so far, each of which has a wealth of details hidden in every nook and cranny. You trigger many interactions and learn new information from just investigating random objects and talking to your travel buddies and NPCs. Just interacting with every trash can in the city of Belobog can raise a reaction from your confused companions. Even Pom-Pom, the Astral Express conductor, seems like he has something new to tell you whenever you visit the Express. On top of that, each Light Cone (weapon-like cards that you attach to your characters to raise their stats and grant them special abilities) has a snippet of lore attached to it, sometimes related to memories of playable characters. There are also tons of in-game books and documents that I might never read, but are there in case anyone wants to take an even deeper dive into the lore.
