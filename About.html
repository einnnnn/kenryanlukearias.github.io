            <h2 class="headings">Story and Setting</h2>
            <p class="brief">The game is set in a science-fantasy universe in which humanity follows the paths of beings called Aeons. The player character, the Trailblazer, whose name and gender are chosen by the player, awakens without their memory aboard a space station and discovers that they are imbued with a Stellaron, a disruptive cosmic entity. They join a band of adventurers, the Trailblazers, traveling from world to world aboard the Astral Express, their space train.<br><br>
                The Trailblazer wakes up and meets two members of the crew, March 7th and Dan Heng. Both are traveling on the Astral Express, a large cosmic train that travels the universe along the eponymous "Star Rail". After eliminating the remaining threats, the Trailblazer meets Himeko, the Astral Express's engineer, and Welt, an interdimensional traveler from the Honkai Impact 3rd universe. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew.<br><br>
                
                Their first destination is Jarilo-VI, a planet that has been mostly ravaged by the Eternal Freeze, an uninhabitable winter due to the power of a Stellaron. As the crew nears, the Astral Express is revealed to be unable to leave until the Stellaron is handled. They are declared fugitives by Supreme Guardian Cocolia due to her paranoia, and escape underground where they learn of the peacekeeping Wildfire and their ongoing conflict with Svarog, the leader of the robots, who has repeatedly rejected peace talks. After settling their differences, the crew returns to the surface to face Cocolia, who merges herself with the Stellaron. The crew defeats her, and Bronya takes her place as the new Supreme Guardian while announcing plans to bridge the two areas.<br><br>
                
                Following the conclusion of the Jarilo-VI storyline, the crew receives a signal from Kafka, who wants the crew to settle a Stellaron incident on the Xianzhou Luofu. As they arrive, they are not permitted to assist in Stellaron affairs but are instead tasked by Cloud Knight general Jing Yuan to weed out Kafka and her Stellaron Hunter cohort Blade, as their presence on the ship is deemed a threat. Upon the crew finding Kafka, she revealed that her job was finished the moment the Trailblazer arrived on the Xianzhou Luofu, an action foreseen by her boss, Elio.

            <h2 class="headings">Impact</h2>
            <p class="brief">Honkai: Star Rail’s success can be attributed to a number of factors. miHoYo’s Genshin Impact has become one of the world’s biggest cross-platform games, achieving three consecutive nominations for Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards, taking home the prize in 2021. This has given the company a significant pedigree in the games space, especially on mobile. The game is reportedly the most downloaded iOS title worldwide and achieved a massive 30 million pre-registered users, 21 million of which came from China alone.

                <br><br>Adding to this, the Honkai series has a pedigree all of its own with the previous entry, Honkai Impact 3rd, reaching a milestone 35 million downloads in 2018. While Genshin Impact is inarguably the company’s biggest success so far, Honkai has a legacy all of its own, and the newest entry could take it to new heights, with mobile leading the charge.
                
                <br><br>The primary release focusing on mobile and PC also points to the company’s continued success on mobile devices. China’s strong preference for mobile gaming is echoed in the continued focus given to the platform by the country’s developers, including miHoYo. Judging by the strong opening, this focus has been successful, and the download figures are likely to continue to climb - there are still some ten million pre-registrations unaccounted for in the day one figures, and with the game seeing its one week anniversary tomorrow further rapid growth can’t be discounted.
