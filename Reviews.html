      <div class="desc-review">This game is so much better than Genshin Impact in my opinion, but its only problem that I played for a week and used 110 warp and didnt get Seele and i got Natasha 8 times</div>

      <div class="desc-review">Everything was perfect for me, graphics, move sets, map and skills. But the red flag was that I have to move everywhere, its not for mobile game, i love to feel its simple just change eq and lvl characters and balance the team and select mission and start the fight just that</div>

        <div class="desc-review">Love this game. The graphics are smooth and beautifully executed. But I have some issues: sometimes the background of the character selection menu or the characters themselves and their weapons during battle are becoming covered with huge pink rectangles, so that you can't see fully what's going on. I suppose that it's a bug with textures, and it really makes playing experience uncomfortable and even annoying. I'd appreciate if you looked into it and fixed this problem</div>

        <div class="desc-review">The game is nice. I have fun and enjoy the mechanics. However, my device is fairly new and the game often crashes mid battle. Due to this, I have to restart my phone and start the battle from the beginning again, even my ability points remain consumed without giving me the buff. It'd be great if you fix this or at least allow players to keep fighting from where they left it even if they leave the game.</div>

        <div class="desc-review">It was fun for a little while but then it got annoying as you go on, you always have to go back and forth with the task you need to complete, the shield for enemies is very annoying because it always goes back up, getting characters is very hard to get and the chances are low, leveling up characters take way too much time because it's such a hard grind to even get materials for it.   </div>

        <div class="desc-review">It has a great story line, and awesome graphics. Despite that, I think it would be nice if the puzzle difficulty could be increased. The combat is also rather repetitive and less exciting as genshin or honkai. Perhaps more tactical elements like reactions between elements, character combo skills, and such could be added to spice things up.</div>

        <div class="desc-review">The game is absolutely great, the gameplay, story line, characters, fighting style, all which I absolutely love. But the constant crash mid game of something about the "Global Error." Or "login failed" is so constant that for more than a day I am unable to stay on game for more than five minutes or unable to enter at all! Please fix this bug.</div>
